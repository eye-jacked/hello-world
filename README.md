# hello-world
greet creation

Hi, my name is Rob. I am trying to learn how to program, if you have any advice for 
a young, inexperienced new entry into the field, I am all ears.

I graduated in Mining Engineering but am trying to switch career paths. I am interested
in Machine Learning and Data science. I currently reside in Poland, and I plan on 
eventually returning to Canada.
